                                The term “conflict” is inadequate to describe the Palestinian question. It holds within it connotations of symmetry, of two conflicting and equal parties, rather than a case of an indigenous population resisting colonial dispossession and ethnocide. It obfuscates that this is not some local squabble between two already existing populations, but a case of foreign settlers seizing land to construct an exclusivist ethnocracy at the expense of the natives. Settler colonialism, by its very definition, is unequal.

                                This is a popular misconception. The United Nations suggested a non-binding partition plan that was never implemented. Furthermore, the United Nations, both its General Assembly as well as its Security Council do not have the jurisdiction to impose political solutions, especially without the consent of those it affects.

Israel was established not through the UN, but through warfare and the creation of facts on the ground. Facts it created through the destruction and ethnic cleansing of hundreds of Palestinian villages and communities.

                                The Nakba is Arabic for “catastrophe” or “calamity”, and it refers to the ethnic cleansing of Palestine at the hand of Zionist militias between 1947-1948 and the subsequent establishment of the state of Israel. This campaign of ethnic cleansing took place before, during and after the war of 1948, and saw approximately 800,000 Palestinians expelled from their homes, and over 530 Palestinian communities demolished. Today, Israel can only maintain itself as an ethnocracy by perpetuating the displacement of these refugees and their descendants.

                                The mainstream usage of the term occupation refers to the occupation of the West Bank, Gaza Strip and East Jerusalem in the 1967 war. These areas remain occupied to this day and are ruled de facto by Israel, who controls most aspects of Palestinian life, down to determining who a Palestinian citizen is. It should be noted that we do not differentiate morally between the take-over of parts of Palestine in 1948 or 1967, as all of it is stolen, colonized land.

                                Gaza is still in fact militarily occupied. For an area to be considered occupied the occupying state must exercise “effective control” over it. Unlike in the past, the Israeli siege, surveillance and monitoring technology allow for effective control of Gaza through controlling select key positions without the necessity of a full occupation force inside the area.

This position is echoed by the United Nations, Amnesty International, the International Red Cross and countless other international organizations specialized in human rights and international humanitarian law.

                                According to international law, it is legitimate for an occupied people to resist occupation by any means available to them. United Nations resolution 37/43 “Reaffirms the legitimacy of the struggle of peoples for independence, territorial integrity, national unity and liberation from colonial and foreign domination and foreign occupation by all available means, including armed struggle”.

It further specifically mentions the Palestinian people as possessing this right:

“Reaffirms the inalienable right of the Namibian people, the Palestinian people and all peoples under foreign and colonial domination to self-determination, national independence, territorial integrity, national unity and sovereignty without outside interference”.

But even if such a right was not enshrined in international law, it is natural for humans to want to rid themselves from the domination of others.

                                An Intifada is an uprising or rebellion against oppression and tyranny. Coming from the Arabic root word nafada, its literal meaning is “shaking off”. The word has come to be strongly associated with the Palestinian cause and resistance to tyranny, especially after the wide-scale protests, civil disobedience, boycotts and other forms of resistance against Israel during the Intifada of 1987 and Aqsa Intifada of 2000.

While the word is heavily associated with Palestine, its usage predates the Palestinian Intifadas. For example, the Bread Intifada of 1977 in Egypt.

                                If internationalist solidarity between oppressed peoples is not a compelling enough reason, it’s important to understand that the same imperialism oppressing Palestinians in Palestine is also oppressing you at home. The same forces of colonialism, supremacy, patriarchy and capitalistic exploitation that committed genocide against the natives, and repressed social justice and liberation movements all over the world are still alive and well, and are always looking for ways to maintain the status quo.

                                Israel is an outpost of world imperialism in the Middle East, it is not supported by the West out of any altruistic intention to “make up” for its genocidal past, it is supported because it aligns with and furthers its interests.

                                For instance, Israel and the United States share violent policing tactics with each other to help suppress any kind of resistance. The same teargas grenades used on protestors in Ferguson are used on protestors in Palestine. The same surveillance and spying technologies tested on Palestinians find their way into the arsenal of other repressive regimes the world over.The International Criminal Tribunal for the former Y

                                Israel prevents Palestinian refugees from returning because it claims they are a security threat. However, seeing as Israel is a settler colony built on stolen land, it did not have the population numbers to sustain itself. It could only be established by creating new demographic realities on the ground, these new realities necessitated that approximately 80% of the Palestinians in what is today considered Israel be ethnically cleansed to maintain a demographically stable Zionist ethnocracy. In short, Israel can only exist because millions of Palestinians are scattered refugees all over the world, simply because they are not Jewish.

“Under international law and the principle of family unity, the children of refugees and their descendants are also considered refugees until a durable solution is found.  Both UNRWA and UNHCR recognize descendants as refugees on this basis, a practice that has been widely accepted by the international community, including both donors and refugee hosting countries. Palestine refugees are not distinct from other protracted refugee situations such as those from Afghanistan or Somalia, where there are multiple generations of refugees, considered by UNHCR as refugees and supported as such. Protracted refugee situations are the result of the failure to find political solutions to their underlying political crises.“

                                Pinkwashing refers to the efforts of Zionist organizations, as well as the Israeli government to invoke LGBTQ+ rights to distract from its human rights violations. This appeal is an attempt to establish a moral superiority for the settler state, and frame the Israeli settler as enlightened, as opposed to the backwards Palestinian Arab. This is all used to legitimize the existence of the Zionist settler-colonial project. It erases queer Palestinians and resistance to ongoing Israeli violence and is itself a form of colonial violence that attempts to further fracture Palestinian society.

                                The term “bluewashing” is a portmanteau of the words “blue” and “whitewash,” which is generally a metaphor for the cover up of crimes committed; the color blue is used because of its association with the United Nation and has thus become associated with humanitarianism and human rights. Bluewashing was first used to <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2000/08/10/opinion/IHT-the-united-nations-sits-in-suspicious-company.html">criticize</a> the corporate partnerships formed under <a href="https://unglobalcompact.org/about">the United Nations Global Compact</a> initiative following credible accusations that this association with the United Nations was <a href="https://archive.nytimes.com/schott.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/02/04/bluewashing/?mtrref=electronicintifada.net&assetType=REGIWALL">undeservedly improving the corporations’ reputations</a>. In short, these partnerships were being used as a fig leaf rather than an honest commitment to any kind of ideal. 

Israel too is quite flagrantly attempting to improve its ugly reputation through a cover of humanitarianism regarding the Palestinians it has been massacring, ethnically cleansing, bombing, imprisoning, and keeping under occupation for over 70 years. Such “humanitarian” work is also intended to ideologically align Israel with the West despite its physical location in the East.

                                While many Palestinian activists and allies have used redwashing to refer to Israel’s cynical weaponization of indigeneity discourse, and its attempted recruitment of the Indigenous peoples of Turtle Island to cover up its settler-colonial nature, we have chosen here instead to use redwashing to refer to depictions of early Zionist institutions in Palestine as socialist, as well as current claims of Zionism being compatible with leftism or even progressivism.

Still, the separate phenomenon of Israel’s audacious indigeneity claims is a significant one also worth critiquing, and so an article addressing this is forthcoming under the title of “Brownwashing”.

                                Purplewashing refers to when organizations or states project a feminist or gender inclusive facade on their politics, in order to make them seem more palatable and promote the image of social responsibility. This is part of an ideological framework referred to by scholars as <a href="https://www.opendemocracy.net/en/imperialist-feminism-and-liberalism/">colonial feminism</a>, whereby women’s rights are appropriated in the service of empire; in the context of Palestine, this rhetoric is also known as gendered Orientalism. The Palestinian Arab/Muslim is framed as an “other”, who is culturally or even genetically predisposed to misogyny. Naturally, this is juxtaposed with the framing of a liberal, enlightened, Israeli Westerner. Ultimately to Israel, this facade of feminism is a way to improve its image, and incorporate women into its violent, colonial, racist systems and institutions, as well as a way to paint Palestinians as unworthy of statehood or even humanity.  The fact that these systems subjugate other -usually Palestinian- women is hardly mentioned.

                                Faithwashing refers to the efforts to frame the question of Palestine as a religious conflict, rather than a case of settler colonialism. This framing suggests that the solution lies through interfaith dialogue, completely sidelining the colonized native population in favor of coopted religious leaders with no connection to Palestine to normalize Israeli settler colonialism.

                                Has it never once sounded suspicious to you how Israelis focus on the “peace offers” that were refused by the Palestinians, but never once discussed the actual parameters or substance in detail?

Because when these parameters are discussed, it becomes clear that these are terms nobody could accept. For example, even when Palestinians accepted the 1967 borders, a very limited return of refugees, and other compromises, this was still not good enough for Israel, which sought to shrink the Palestinian Bantustan even further and deny any real sovereignty to the supposed Palestinian state. These arrangements seek to formalize the status quo with cosmetic changes. Netanyahu promised that no Palestinian state will emerge, and in the case of any limited self-rule arrangement for the Palestinians, he spoke about a permanent IDF presence in the West Bank, as well as Israeli control of the borders and airspace. These are the amazing “opportunities” that Palestinians have been declining, and as a result are being painted as warmongering rejectionists for doing so. As it stands, Palestinian aspirations cannot exceed the ceiling of Israeli table scraps. Furthermore, this talking point purposefully ignores Palestinian counter-offers and proposals that Israel has rejected over the years, solely to paint Palestinians in a bad light.

                                Not at all. The idea that Barak offered Arafat “everything” which he rejected is a media spin to blame the Palestinians for the failure of the negotiations. Once actually inspected, you will come to see that Barak’s “generous offer” lacked many aspects that would enable the emergence of a sovereign Palestinian state:

The claim that Palestinians were offered 96% of land in the West Bank sounds “generous”, only then to find out that this 96% excluded areas already under Israeli control, such as the Dead Sea, the Jordan Valley, and East Jerusalem, effectively shrinking down the West Bank to around 80% at the most generous of estimates. In return, Israel was prepared to give an equivalent of 1% of land in the Naqab desert to the Palestinian state.

The West Bank would be crisscrossed by a network of settlements and Israeli areas, neatly dividing it into cantons with very little contiguity or connections. Even the noble sanctuary and the Aqsa mosque, as well as around a third of East Jerusalem would remain under permanent Israeli sovereignty in the supposed Palestinian capital. This is not even to mention that the Palestinian right of return was completely brushed under the carpet, with the Israelis not even allowing some refugees to return to the future Palestinian state.

None of this was conducive for the establishment of a real, sovereign and viable Palestinian state. Shlomo Ben Ami, Israeli Minister of Foreign Affairs at the time, and one of the main negotiators at Camp David, candidly <a href="https://www.democracynow.org/2006/2/14/fmr_israeli_foreign_minister_shlomo_ben">admitted</a> later that “Camp David was not the missed opportunity for the Palestinians, and if I were a Palestinian I would have rejected Camp David, as well.”

                                Zionism is a colonial ideology and political movement that calls for establishing a Jewish nation state in Palestine with a Jewish majority. Seeing as Palestine was already inhabited, and that there were barely any Zionists there before the 20th century, this necessitated the oppression and expulsion of the Palestinians to create the necessary conditions for this state.

                                The claim that Zionism is just Jewish self-determination has become popular as of late, but it is rife with critical omissions. It is akin to describing manifest destiny as “pilgrims seeking a better life for themselves”.  While this definition is convenient to its proponents, it leaves out the horrific acts of barbarity committed towards those ends. Israel as a colonial project was not created in a vacuum, its establishment necessitated the active  oppression and dispossession of the Palestinians.

Palestine has always been home to countless refugee populations, the idea that the Jewish people fleeing persecution could find a safe home in Palestine was never the issue. The issue is that these sentiments were <a href="https://bookscouter.com/book/0521683157-a-history-of-modern-palestine-one-land-two-peoples?type=buy">never reciprocated</a> by the Zionist movement, who showed disdain towards Palestinians from the very beginning and sought to take over the land with the aim of establishing an exclusive ethnic state.

                                No, since their arrival the Zionist settlers exploited Palestinian hospitality and worked towards the aim of establishing an ethnocratic settler state at their expense. They banned Arab workers, established a Jewish only trade union, and censured those buying Arab produce or cooperating in any manner. As Menachem Usishkin, chairman of the Jewish National Fund said, they wanted to be the “landlords of this land”. Even before any physical Zionist settlement, Herzl wrote about ways to get rid of the population already living there.

                                No, criticism of Israel and its founding ideology cannot be conflated with the hatred of the Jewish people. When Palestinians resist Israeli colonialism, it is not due to the religion or ethnicity of Israelis. Resistance to foreign domination has been a staple of oppressed and colonized people all across the globe. From the very beginning, the Zionist movement had the goal of establishing an exclusivist ethnic state at the expense of the natives already living there, Palestinians objecting to and resisting this endeavor cannot be compared to the odious, murderous antisemitism that plagued Europe throughout history.

This is not                     even to mention that most Zionists today aren’t even Jewish, and many anti-Zionists are.

                                Israel is a settler colony. Settler colonialism differs from classic colonialism, in that settler colonialism only initially and temporarily relies on an empire for their existence. In many situations, the colonists aren’t even from the empire supporting them, and end up fighting the very sponsor that ensured their survival in the first place. Another difference is that settlers are not merely interested in the resources of these new lands, but also in the lands themselves, and to carve out a new homeland for themselves in the area.

                                The obvious issue here is that these lands were already inhabited by other people before their arrival.

                                To begin with, Palestine is situated in the fertile crescent, and is one of the birth places of agriculture. It was never as much a desert as the Zionist narrative claims. The vast majority of cultivated agricultural land in Israel today was already being cultivated by Palestinians before their ethnic cleansing. Schechtman <a href="https://bookscouter.com/book/0679720987-the-birth-of-israel-myths-and-realities?type=buy">estimates</a> that on the eve of the 1948 war, around 2,990,000 dunams of land (or 739,750 acres) were being cultivated by Palestinians. These cultivated lands were so vast, that <a href="https://www.jstor.org/stable/2536511?seq=1">they were </a>“greater than the physical area which was under cultivation in Israel almost thirty years later.” It took Israel 30 years to even equal the amount of land being cultivated before its establishment. Alan George continues: “The impressive expansion of Israel’s cultivated area since 1948 has been more apparent than real since it involved mainly the ‘reclamation’ of farmland belonging to the refugees.”

                                Another aspect we should be wary of is reading desert as to mean uncultivated. Palestinian Bedouins have long cultivated lands in the Naqab desert using traditional farming and water preserving techniques. Records show that despite the loud proclamations of Zionists making the desert bloom, in 1944 land cultivated by Palestinians in the Naqab desert alone was <a href="https://bookscouter.com/book/0887281567-from-haven-to-conquest?type=buy">three times</a> of that cultivated by the entire Zionist settler presence in Palestine. As a matter of fact, the amount of cultivated land in the Naqab desert <a href="https://bookscouter.com/book/1873765061-palestine-an-inescapable-duty?type=buy">has dropped</a> significantly since the Nakba in 1947-48. This is yet another case of a popular Zionist slogan being the complete opposite of reality.

                                No, Israel is an ethnocracy, which is a political system dominated by a specific ethnic group, and its policies revolve around furthering the interests of said group to the detriment of the rest. Usually ethnocracies have a thin democratic facade, but while it has the nominative and formal criteria of democracy, the way it functions is counter to the core spirit and ideas of democracy, such as equality among the populace.

                                Israel distinguishes between citizenship and nationality. For example, you can be a citizen of Israel but be a Druze national, or a Jewish national. Your nationality is determined by your ethnicity and it cannot be changed or challenged. Many of the rights you are accorded in Israel stem from your nationality not your citizenship. Meaning an “Arab” Israeli citizen and a Jewish Israeli citizen, while both citizens, enjoy different rights and privileges determined by their “nationality”. Seeing how Israel is an ethnocracy it is not a mystery who this system privileges and who it discriminates against. This discrimination is enshrined both in law and in practice.

                                Hasbara, meaning “explaining” is Israeli public diplomacy, especially that aimed at international audiences. It seeks to spread a positive image of Israel and legitimize its actions, often through outright false talking points and demonization of Palestinians. It is a state-backed endeavor, with fellowships, organizations and other funded activities to spread it. In short, Israeli propaganda.

                                The Boycott, Disinvestment and Sanctions (BDS) movement is a non-violent human rights campaign formed in 2005 by over 170 Palestinian non-governmental organizations, unions and civil society groups. The campaign aims to apply international pressure (economic and otherwise) on Israel until it complies with international law, in order to protect the rights of Palestinians. The BDS movement does not take a position on political solutions, as it is strictly a human rights movement.

                                1.Ending Israeli occupation and colonization of all Arab lands and dismantling the Wall.<br>
                                2.Recognizing the fundamental rights of the Palestinian citizens of Israel to full equality.<br>
                                3.Respecting, protecting and promoting the rights of Palestinian refugees to return to their homes and properties as stipulated in UN resolution 194.<br>
                                Simply put, the consistent application of international law.

                                Objective, yes. Neutral, not at all.

                                There is a common misconception, that in order to be objective you need to be neutral. These concepts can be connected but they do not necessarily follow from each other. Having two points of view does not automatically mean that both points of view are equally legitimate or based in reality, or that the truth has to be located somewhere in the middle. For example, you can of course bring two opposing sides to discuss if climate change is real or not, but treating them both as equally valid and of equal worth when one is backed by scientific consensus and the other isn’t is not a fair and balanced representation of reality. It is a false equation of two sides simply for being two different sides. This actually gives legitimacy to reactionary and anti-scientific positions.

                                Similarly, Israeli colonialism and ethnic cleansing of Palestinians is an objective fact. Maintaining a neutral position on this war crime is not only immoral, but enables Israel to commit further heinous acts in the future. Therefore, we take a very clear position: For the liberation of Palestine. However, all of our information and sources are objective and based on rigorous academic scholarship and testimonies.
